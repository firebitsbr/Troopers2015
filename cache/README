Most of the tests will crash your machine. So, do not execute these
tests on production machines because, more than the crash, you may
experience other effects such as loose some files due to filesystem
crash.

Before running any kernel module, make sure there is only 1 thread
in execution. disable_threads.sh is a script that achieves that for
a system with 8 threads. If your system has a different number of
threads, please, change this script.



async_cache_memory:
	- Proves CR3 does not use cache when PAE is being used
	- Creates an async between cache and memory on the PDPTEs
	- Invalidates the cache in a way that the PDPTEs changed
	  in the cache are not written back to memory

	- make clean ; make ; insmod cache.ko ; rmmod cache



no_fill_mode:
	- Shows behavior of no-fill mode
	- In the code (lib.S), there are comments to test two
	  behaviors of no-fill mode: invd that does not invalidates
	  the cache and the write-back that happens when leaving the
	  no-fill mode.
	- This code can be modified in many other ways to test other
	  characteristics of no-fill mode.

	- make clean ; make ; insmod cache.ko
		- This code crashes - this is exactly the idea of it :)
